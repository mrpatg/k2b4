## Installation

1. Download the repo or clone it
2. Place the theme/extracted folder into your wp-content/themes directory (should be wp-content/themes/k2b4/)
3. Make the theme active in Dashboard->Appearences. 

## Requirements

* WordPress 5.0+ (Update your installs you goons.)
* PHP 7+ (It will probably work on php 5x, but I don't want to support that. So you're on your own.)

## Who the hell is that guy in the picture?

That is some guy from a pexels picture. I needed to church up the background and thought he looked like he was having a load of fun so I tossed him in there.

## Your code is trash

Better than your moms. But for real, MOST of it isn't mine at all. This build is built using the B4ST theme from [Simon Padbury](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st).
