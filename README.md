## About Me

Hey gang.

I'm Patrick, a web developer who has worked with WordPress for a very long time, since around 2006. One of the first themes I remember utilizing was the k2 theme. Among the options for free themes at the time, it appealed most to my sense of clean minimalism while injecting a splash of personality. 

Just for fun, I thought it would be neat to re-create the design using a modern responsive framework (bootstrap 4). I opted to build this using one of my favorite starter themes, B4ST (https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st). There is still plenty of work left to do w/ this theme, but if you like it, leave an issue and I'll get to it. 

Thanks
