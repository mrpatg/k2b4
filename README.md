## Installation

Download the repo or clone it, and install the theme. Nothing fancy going on here.

## Requirements

* WordPress 5.0+ (Update your installs you goons.)
* PHP 7+ (It will probably work on php 5x, but I don't want to support that. So you're on your own.)

## About Me

Hey gang.

I'm Patrick, a web developer who has worked with WordPress for a very long time, since around 2006. One of the first themes I remember utilizing was the k2 theme. Among the options for free themes at the time, it appealed most to my sense of clean minimalism while injecting a splash of personality. 

Just for fun, I thought it would be neat to re-create the design using a modern responsive framework (bootstrap 4). I opted to build this using one of my favorite starter themes, B4ST (https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st). There is still plenty of work left to do w/ this theme, but if you like it, leave an issue and I'll get to it. 

Thanks

## Who the hell is that guy?

That is some guy from a pexels picture. I needed to church up the background and thought he looked like he was having a load of fun so I tossed him in there.

## Your code is trash

Better than your moms.
