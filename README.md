## About

The K2 WordPress theme (2006) was an iconic theme in the early days of WordPress. It was created by Michael Heilemann, and is archived on github [here](https://github.com/Heilemann/k2-for-wordpress). You can learn more about K2 itself by visiting his website [here](http://binarybonsai.com/getk2).

## Demo

 A static generated demo of this theme is available [here](https://mrpatg.github.io/k2b4demo/). 

## Installation

1. Download the repo or clone it
2. Place the theme/extracted folder into your wp-content/themes directory (should be wp-content/themes/k2b4/)
3. Make the theme active in Dashboard->Appearences. 

## Requirements

* WordPress 5.0+ (Update your installs you goons.)
* PHP 7+ (It will probably work on php 5x, but I don't want to support that. So you're on your own.)

## Contributions

Please submit any issues you find w/ the theme/layout. If you want to make fixes, do so and submit a pull request.

## Who the hell is that guy in the picture?

That is some guy from a pexels picture. I needed to church up the background and thought he looked like he was having a load of fun so I tossed him in there.

## Your code is trash

Better than your moms. But for real, MOST of it isn't mine at all. This build is built using the B4ST theme from [Simon Padbury](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st). 

## License
